## 0. Installation of Ubuntu 20.04
The following Dual Boot of Ubuntu showed me almost about no errors as i did perfect partition of disk management .
The following encounters that i have faced is that :

!!! Before installation of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ( latest version ) !!!
 * Had a wifi connectivityissue of Amrita Connect in my ubuntu Dual Boot of version 22.04 
 * Had an Issue in Boot Locker Recovery Drive during the intial booting startup 
 
 --- Solutions Done to the following errors i have faced ---
 * Realized the problem and i had to uninstall the previous Ubuntu 22.04 version and installed the Ubuntu 20.04 version , which later cleared my problem and the Dual Boot was working fine and smooth. 
 * The Boot Locker Recovery Drive problem was cleared as once again i
 *  removed the security to the hard disk drive which i had partitioned and the error message is no longer visisble.
